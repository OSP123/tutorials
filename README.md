# [Web Tutorials](https://osp123.github.io/tutorials/)

[This is a Bootstrap Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/). Creative is a theme I'm using for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Getting Started
I've created a Series of Web Tutorials and give free permission to use and modify them however you wish.
If you do end up using the tutorials, I just ask that you give me credit by linking to my blog: http://hardlydent.tumblr.com/. Thanks!

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
